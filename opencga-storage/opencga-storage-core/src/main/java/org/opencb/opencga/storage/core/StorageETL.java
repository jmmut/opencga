/**
 * ETL cycle consists of the following execution steps:
 * extract: fetch data from different sources to be processed, eg. remote servers (S3), move to HDFS, ...
 * pre-transform: data is prepared to be transformed, this may include data validation and uncompression
 * transform: business rules are applied and some integrity checks can be applied
 * post-transform: some cleaning, validation or other actions can be taken into account
 * pre-load: transformed data can be validated or converted to physical schema in this step
 * load: in this step a DBWriter from getDBWriter (see below) is used to load data in the storage engine
 * post-load: data can be cleaned and some database validations can be performed
